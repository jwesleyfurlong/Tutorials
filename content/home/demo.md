I am the founder and managing director of Telos Analytics, a data and analytics firm for the social sector. The goal of this site is to provide resources and support for social workers responsible for data in their agencies. Tutorials, blogs, and course resources cover many aspects of data, statistical, and spatial analysis using R, Power BI, and ArcGIS. Occasional posts about foster care, Newfoundland dogs or rock climbing are also known to appear at times. My primary methodological research interests include using machine learning and causal inference methods for program evaluation, especially to answer questions like, "How are particular sub-groups affected by a program or intervention?" My primary empirical area of focus is child welfare. I really enjoy working with agencies to leverage their data to improve decision-making and hope this site provides practical and accessible support for internal program evaluation.
